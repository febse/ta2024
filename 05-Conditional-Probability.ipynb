    "Suppose that you are playing a game of two dice and you want to bet that the first die will show a 6. A fried of yours rolls the dice and tells you that the sum of the two dice is 7. What is the probability that the first die shows a 6 _given_ that the sum of the two dice is 7? Would this additional information help you when deciding whether to bet on the first die showing a 6?\n",
