## Grading

TBA

## GitHub Repository

All course materials will be available in the GitHub repository:

[{{< var github >}}]({{< var github >}})

## Google Colaboratory

The course material will be presented using Jupyter notebooks. The recommended way to work with the notebooks is through Google Colaboratory, a cloud service that allows you to run Jupyter notebooks through a web browser. However, you will need a Google account to use it. If you don't have one, please register here: <https://accounts.google.com/signup>.

## Local Software Setup (Optional)

The recommended way to run the notebooks is to use Google Colab. However, if you prefer to work locally, you will need a recent version of Python (3.11 is recommended) and the dependencies listed in the `environment.yml` file in the GitHub repository.

2. Install `miniconda` from [https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html). **You don't need this step if you already have another conda installation (e.g. Anaconda)**.
3. Install Visual Studio Code (VSC) from [https://code.visualstudio.com/](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

- Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` and type `Python: Create Environment`. Select the `.conda` option, then select `Python 3.11` from the dropdown menu. This will create a new folder called `.conda` in the repository folder and will install the Python packages listed in the `environment.yml` file.
