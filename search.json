    "text": "Software Setup\nThe exercise classes require a minimal software setup:\n\nInstall Git for you operating system from https://git-scm.com/downloads/.\nOpen a GitHub account at https://github.com/signup. While you don’t need an account to download the course materials, you will need one to receive and submit your assignments (this will be explained in details during the exercise classes). You can apply for the GitHub student benefits at https://education.github.com/benefits. If approved you can receive free access to the GitHub Pro plan and to GitHub Copilot, an AI tool that helps you write code.\nOpen https://cran.r-project.org/, and you will find links to R builds for different operating systems. Click on the link matching your operating system and choose the latest version of R. When using the Windows operating system, you will see a link “Install R for the first time.” Click on this link and then download the R installer. Run the installer. Leave the default settings unchanged unless you know what you are doing.\nAfter installing R, open https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/. If the web page recognizes your operating system, you will see a download button (right side of the page) for R studio. If the button does not appear, scroll down the page and find the installer appropriate for your operating system.\nShould you encounter difficulties installing R and R Studio, you can watch these video guides:\n\n\nWindows\nMac\nUbuntu 22.04\n\n\nHere are some video guides on how to install git:\n\n\nWindows\nMac\nLinux\n\n\nThe following steps depend on git being installed. Open R Studio and open a new project dialog: File -&gt; New Project. In the dialog, click on the third option: version control. From the next menu, select git.\n\n  \nIn the Repository URL field, paste the address of the course repository:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRepository URL\n\n\n\nInsert the following address in the Repository URL field:\nhttps://github.com/febse/stat2024.git\nthe one shown in the screenshot is outdated.\n\n\n Click on the Create Project button and wait for git R studio to clone the repository and open the project.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRenv\n\n\n\nTo install the packages necessary for the course, click on the command line in the R console and type:\nrenv::restore()\nThis will trigger the download and installation of all the dependencies. It can take some time, so be patient. You only need to do it once.\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 5\n\n\n 6. The content of the GitHub repository will be updated continuously throughout the semester. In order to download the new files or updated versions of already existing files, you can use git pull. Open the git window in the upper right pane of R studio and click the pull button. This will download all changes from the GitHub repository to your local copy.\n\n\n\nStep 7\n\n\n\nNote that if you have modified the files tracked by git that have changed in the repository, git pull will fail with an error similar to this one:\n\n\n\n\nPull error\n\n\nTo avoid this, you can roll back the file to its original state. Right-click on the file in the git window and choose “revert.”\n\n\n\nRevert\n\n\n\nIn the exercise classes, we will use many functions from the tidyverse system and several other packages. Before accessing these packages’ functionality, you need to install them first. Find the R console in R studio and paste the following line on the command line. Press enter to run it and wait for the installation to complete. The renv package will take care of the installation of the packages in a separate environment, so you should’t worry about installing packages.\n\nIn case it does not work, you can install the packages manually by running the following command in the R console:\ninstall.packages(c(\"tidyverse\", \"broom\"))\nOptional: more on Quarto: https://quarto.org/docs/guide/\nOptional: a base R cheatsheet: https://www.datacamp.com/cheat-sheet/getting-started-r\nOptional: R for Data Science: https://r4ds.hadley.nz/",

This is called recycling or broadcasting.\nLet’s run an example to see how recycling works. We want to add a scalar to each element of a vector. Mathematically, this does not make sense, because you can only add/subtract element-wise two vectors of the same length. However, R will recycle the scalar to match the length of the vector. Recycling means that it creates a new vector by repeating the shorter vector until it has the same length as the longer vector.\n\nc(2, 5) + 1\n\n[1] 3 6\n\n\n\nc(2, 3, 5, 7) + c(10, 20)\n\n[1] 12 23 15 27\n\nc(2, 3, 5, 7) / c(10, 20)\n\n[1] 0.20 0.15 0.50 0.35\n\n\nTake care when using recycling, because it can lead to unexpected results. For example, if you try to add two vectors of different lengths, R will still recycle the shorter vector to match the length of the longer vector, but it will also issue a warning.\n\nc(1, 2, 10) + c(2, 5)\n\nWarning in c(1, 2, 10) + c(2, 5): longer object length is not a multiple of\nshorter object length\n\n\n[1]  3  7 12\n\n\nPay attention to the warning message. It is telling you that the shorter vector is being recycled to match the length of the longer vector but it cannot expand the shorter vector to match the longer vector exactly. Although this is not an error that will stop your program, most of the time, this is not what you want and is a result from some error before it. You should not rely on recycling vectors of incompatible lengths. Instead, you should be explicit about what you want to do.",

For example, you may get a result like this:\n\nsqrt(2)^2 == 2\n\n[1] FALSE\n\n\nMathematically, \\sqrt(2)^2 is exactl yequal to 2, but the comparison in R returns FALSE.\nWhen printing the number in the console you may not see the difference because the print function formats the number.

    "text": "2.9 Functions\nFunctions are a fundamental building block most languages, including R. They are used to carry out a specific task and encapsulate a sequence of steps. You can avoid repeating the same code over and over again by abstracting the code into a function.\nYou can think of a function as a recipe. It takes some ingredients (arguments) and returns a dish (output).\nLet’s look at some examples of functions in R, without going into too much detail.\nTo define a function, you use the function keyword and assing the function to a variable. The function is then called by using the variable name and passing the arguments in parentheses. The function has a body that is enclosed in curly braces.\nLet’s write a function that takes two numbers and returns TRUE or FALSE depending on whether the sum of the arguments is odd. Functions return the value of the last expression in the body of the function unless you explicitly use the return keyword.\n\nis_even_sum &lt;- function(x, y) {\n  # print((x + y) %% 2)\n  (x + y) %% 2 == 0\n}\n\nis_even_sum(2, 3)\n\n[1] FALSE\n\nis_even_sum(2, 4)\n\n[1] TRUE\n\n\nThe %% operator is the modulo operator. It returns the remainder of the division of the first value by the second value.\n\n2 %% 2\n\n[1] 0\n\n3 %% 2\n\n[1] 1\n\n\nWriting functions is a large topic and we will not cover all the details in this course. You can find more information about functions in R in the R documentation.\nA thing to note is that R is (mostly) a functional programming language and functions generally do not modify their arguments. This means that if you pass a variable to a function and the function modifies that variable, the original value will not be changed. This is different from many other languages, where functions can modify their arguments. The reason for this is that arguments are copied when they are passed to a function. This is done to avoid side effects and make the code easier to reason about.\n\nx &lt;- c(1, 2, 3)\n\nf &lt;- function(y) {\n  y[1] &lt;- 100\n  y\n}\n\nf(x)\n\n[1] 100   2   3\n\nx\n\n[1] 1 2 3\n\n\nThe function above assigns a value to the frst element of the vector y and returns the modified vector. However, the original vector x is not modified, because y is a copy of x.\n\ns1 &lt;- c(4, 1, 2, 3)\ns1\n\n[1] 4 1 2 3\n\ns1[1] &lt;- 100\ns1\n\n[1] 100   1   2   3",

Most of the time we will use tibble objects to hold the data. tibble objects are a modern rewrite of the data.frame (an older object type for storing data).\nTo use it we need to load the dplyr package, a part of the tidyverse collection of packages.\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n── Attaching core tidyverse packages ──────────────────────── tidyverse 2.0.0 ──\n✔ dplyr     1.1.4     ✔ readr     2.1.5\n✔ forcats   1.0.0     ✔ stringr   1.5.1\n✔ ggplot2   3.5.1     ✔ tibble    3.2.1\n✔ lubridate 1.9.3     ✔ tidyr     1.3.1\n✔ purrr     1.0.2     \n── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──\n✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()\n✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()\nℹ Use the conflicted package (&lt;http://conflicted.r-lib.org/&gt;) to force all conflicts to become errors\nIn a limited number of cases we need to construct tables by hand.

    "section": "3.2 Basic data summaries",
    "text": "3.2 Basic data summaries\nThe first step in any data analysis is to gain an initial understanding of the context of the data and the distributions of the variables of interest. In this course our main focus will be on two features of the variables: their location and their variability (how different are the observations between each other).\n\n3.2.1 Location\nThe most important measure of location for us will be the empirical mean of a variable (arithmetic average). Let i index the observation in our data set from the first (i = 1) to the last i = n. In our case n = 1816: the number of all interviewed customers. We can represent the values of some (numeric) characteristic (e.g., the persons’ weight) as a vector of values x = (x_1, \\ldots, x_n). In this notation x_1 is the weight of the first customer in the data set (x_1 = 210 pounds). The arithmetic average is defined as the sum of all values divided by the number of observations:\n\n\\bar{x} = \\frac{1}{n}(x_1 + x_2 + \\ldots + x_n) = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i = 1}^{n} x_i\n\nLet us now compute the arithmetic average of weight and height. One way to access the columns of the data set earnings is to write the name of the data set and then after a $ sign the name of the column.\n\nmean(earnings$height)\n\n[1] 66.56883\n\nmean(earnings$weight, na.rm = TRUE)\n\n[1] 156.3052\n\n\nAnother measure of location is the (empirical) median. You can compute it using the median function.\n\nmedian(earnings$height)\n\n[1] 66\n\n\nThe result is a median height of 66 inches. This means that about half of the customers were taller than 66 inches.\n\n\n3.2.2 Variability (Spread)\nThe next important feature of the data is its variability. It answers the following question: how different are the customers between each other with respect to body height (for example). There are numerous ways to measure variability.\nOne intuitive measure would be the range of the data, defined as the difference by the maximal observed height and the minimal observed height\n\nmin(earnings$height)\n\n[1] 57\n\nmax(earnings$height)\n\n[1] 82\n\nrange(earnings$height)\n\n[1] 57 82\n\n\n\nmax(earnings$height) - min(earnings$height)\n\n[1] 25\n\n\nAnother measure is the inter-quartile range. The quartiles are defined similar to the median. To see this lets use the example of body height. The first quartile of height (25-th percentile and 0.25 quantile are different names for the same thing) is the height for which about one quarter of the customers are shorter than it. You can compute it with the function quantile.\n\nquantile(earnings$height, 0.25)\n\n25% \n 64 \n\n\nAbout 25 percent of our customers were shorter than 64 inches.\nThe second quartile is the same as the median (two quarters).\n\nquantile(earnings$height, 0.5)\n\n50% \n 66 \n\nmedian(earnings$height)\n\n[1] 66\n\n\nThe third quartile is the height for which three quarter of the customers are shorter than it.\n\nquantile(earnings$height, 0.75)\n\n  75% \n69.25 \n\n\nIn our case about three quarter of the customers were shorter than 69.25 inches.\nThe inter-quartile range is simply the difference between the third quartile and the second quartile.\n\nquantile(earnings$height, 0.75) - quantile(earnings$height, 0.25)\n\n 75% \n5.25 \n\n\nAbout half of our customers had a hight between the first quartile (64 inches) and the third quartile (69.25 inches). The inter-quartile range shows you the difference between the height of the talles person and the shortest person for the central 50 percent of the customers.\nAs the range, the inter-quartile range is a measure of variability.\nThe most important measure of variability and the one that will be central to our analysis is the (empirical) variance.\n\nDefinition 3.1 (Empirical Variance) For a vector of values x = (x_1, \\ldots, x_n) it is defined as the average (apart from a small correction in the denominator) squared deviation of the values from their mean.\n\nS^2_x = \\frac{(x_1 - \\bar{x})^2 + \\ldots + (x_n - \\bar{x})^2}{n - 1} = \\frac{1}{n - 1} \\sum_{i = 1}^{n}(x_i - \\bar{x})^2: \\quad \\text{variance}\\\\\nS_x = \\sqrt{S^2_x} \\quad \\text{standard deviation}\n\n\n\nExample 3.1 (Computing the empirical variance) Lets apply the formula from Definition 3.1 to a very simple example with just three values.\n\nx_1 = -1, x_2 = 0, x_3 = 4\n\nFirst, the empirical mean of these values is\n\n\\bar{x} = \\frac{-1 + 0 + 4}{3} = 1\n\nNow lets substitute these values in the definition of the empirical variance:\n\n\\begin{aligned}\nS^2_{x} & = \\frac{(x_1 - \\bar{x})^2 + (x_2 - \\bar{x})^2 + (x_3 - \\bar{x})^2 }{n - 1} \\\\\n        & = \\frac{(-1 - 1)^2 + (0 - 1)^2 + (4 - 1)^2 }{3 - 1} \\\\\n        & = \\frac{(-2)^2 + (- 1)^2 + (3 )^2 }{2} \\\\\n        & = \\frac{4 + 1 + 9 }{2} \\\\\n        & = \\frac{14}{2} \\\\\n        & = 7\n\\end{aligned}\n\nUsing R to compute the same thing:\n\n# Create a vector called x\nx &lt;- c(-1, 0, 4)\n# Compute the average of the values in x and store it in a variable called x_avg (look it up in the global environment)\n\nx_avg &lt;- mean(x)\n\n# Manually compute the variance of x\n((-1 - x_avg)^2 + (0 - x_avg)^2 + (4 - x_avg)^2) / (length(x) - 1)\n\n[1] 7\n\n\nThere is also a special function var that can compute it from a vector\n\nvar(x)\n\n[1] 7\n\n\nThe (empirical) standard deviation is simply the square root of the (empirical) variance.\n\nS_x = \\sqrt{S^2_x} = \\sqrt{7} \\approx 2.64\n\nIn R you have two options: take the square root of the result of var using the sqrt function or use sd (standard deviation) to compute the standard deviation directly.\n\nsqrt(var(x))\n\n[1] 2.645751\n\nsd(x)\n\n[1] 2.645751\n\n\n\n\nExercise 3.1 (Empirical Moments (Mean and Variance))  \n\nCompute the sample mean and variance of the annual earnings of the customers in the earnings data set. First, compute it by accessing the columns of the data using the dollar syntax.\n\n\nThen use the summarize function from the dplyr (already loaded) package to compute the mean and the variance of the earn variable.\n\n\nRun the same calculations as before, but this time group the dataset by the ethnicity variable. This will give you the mean and the variance of the annual earnings for every ethnic group in the data set. Use the group_by function.\n\n\n\n\n3.2.3 Overview of the data\nThe skim function from the skimr package provides a quick overview of the data set. It shows the number of observations, the number of variables, the names of the variables, the type of the variables, the number of missing values, the mean, the standard deviation, the minimum and maximum values, and the quartiles for the numeric variables.\n\n## Basic summaries for the whole tibble\nearnings %&gt;% skimr::skim()\n\n\nData summary\n\n\nName\nPiped data\n\n\nNumber of rows\n1816\n\n\nNumber of columns\n17\n\n\n_______________________\n\n\n\nColumn type frequency:\n\n\n\ncharacter\n1\n\n\nnumeric\n16\n\n\n________________________\n\n\n\nGroup variables\nNone\n\n\n\nVariable type: character\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nskim_variable\nn_missing\ncomplete_rate\nmin\nmax\nempty\nn_unique\nwhitespace\n\n\n\n\nethnicity\n0\n1\n5\n8\n0\n4\n0\n\n\n\nVariable type: numeric\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nskim_variable\nn_missing\ncomplete_rate\nmean\nsd\np0\np25\np50\np75\np100\nhist\n\n\n\n\nheight\n0\n1.00\n66.57\n3.83\n57.00\n64.00\n66.00\n69.25\n82.00\n▂▇▅▁▁\n\n\nweight\n27\n0.99\n156.31\n34.62\n80.00\n130.00\n150.00\n180.00\n342.00\n▅▇▃▁▁\n\n\nmale\n0\n1.00\n0.37\n0.48\n0.00\n0.00\n0.00\n1.00\n1.00\n▇▁▁▁▅\n\n\nearn\n0\n1.00\n21147.30\n22531.77\n0.00\n6000.00\n16000.00\n27000.00\n400000.00\n▇▁▁▁▁\n\n\nearnk\n0\n1.00\n21.15\n22.53\n0.00\n6.00\n16.00\n27.00\n400.00\n▇▁▁▁▁\n\n\neducation\n2\n1.00\n13.24\n2.56\n2.00\n12.00\n12.00\n15.00\n18.00\n▁▁▁▇▃\n\n\nmother_education\n244\n0.87\n13.61\n3.22\n3.00\n12.00\n13.00\n16.00\n99.00\n▇▁▁▁▁\n\n\nfather_education\n295\n0.84\n13.65\n3.25\n3.00\n12.00\n13.00\n16.00\n99.00\n▇▁▁▁▁\n\n\nwalk\n0\n1.00\n5.30\n2.60\n1.00\n3.00\n6.00\n8.00\n8.00\n▃▁▃▁▇\n\n\nexercise\n0\n1.00\n3.05\n2.32\n1.00\n1.00\n2.00\n5.00\n7.00\n▇▁▁▁▃\n\n\nsmokenow\n1\n1.00\n1.75\n0.44\n1.00\n1.00\n2.00\n2.00\n2.00\n▃▁▁▁▇\n\n\ntense\n1\n1.00\n1.42\n2.16\n0.00\n0.00\n0.00\n2.00\n7.00\n▇▁▁▁▁\n\n\nangry\n1\n1.00\n1.42\n2.16\n0.00\n0.00\n0.00\n2.00\n7.00\n▇▁▁▁▁\n\n\nage\n0\n1.00\n42.93\n17.16\n18.00\n29.00\n39.00\n56.00\n91.00\n▇▇▃▃▁\n\n\nheight_cm\n0\n1.00\n169.08\n9.73\n144.78\n162.56\n167.64\n175.89\n208.28\n▂▇▅▁▁\n\n\nweight_kg\n27\n0.99\n70.34\n15.58\n36.00\n58.50\n67.50\n81.00\n153.90\n▅▇▃▁▁\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.2.4 Summarizing a single categorical variable\nWhile the mean, median, and variance are useful for numeric variables, they are not defined for categorical variables.
